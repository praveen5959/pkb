## What we did before Hack.
We didn't prepare anything before the hack but we are using some part of the ccode which we had used in previous projects.
The previous projects can be found at https://github.com/Datron/

## Roadmap for Hack

### 1. Text Recognition:
Geting text from the scanned RC card using AWS Recokgnition service.
The text contains all the details present in the RC Card.

### 2. Stroing the Text:
The text from the Text Recognition is stored in DB (Firebase Cloud Storage).

### 3. Authentication Feature:
Setting up authentication feature using Firebase Authentication feature.

### 4. Storing the image:
String the scanned image of RC Card in user's account so that he/she can check the previous scanned copies of RC Card.

## Dependencies Used:
1. AWS SDK for Java: Included to link AWS with Android project.
